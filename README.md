# Java-Calculator
Created a Programmer version of the Windows calculator that includes hexadecimal, decimal, octal and binary (bitwise steps such as Xor, Not, And) calculations.  

Update: Had a few issues with the implementation of Java swing and some layout managers which lead to small button sizes. The button descriptions show up as ellipses so that needs to be fixed.
